## Features  
- WordPress APIs wrappers leveraging OOP
- DI Container supporting: aliases, singletons, intersection types, autowiring, method calls, configurations.  
- User defined configurations: auto-discovered and loaded at runtime, providing a facade for simple and clean APIs.
- Guards: simple to use - advanced checks to protect your code from unexpected inputs and behaviours.
- Out-of-the-box Templating Engine.
